ROADMAP
1. Fully passing DMC tests.
2. Fully passing IRQ tests.
    mmc3_test/4-scanline off-by-1
    irq_and_dma
3. Fully working MMC5.
4. Expansion Audio
5. Remaining test ROMs.
6. Joypad support
7. PPU Mask support
8. See if BankIndex can be resolved immediately. Late resolution is causing a lot of clutter.
9. Proper sounding audio.

Add CHR bank viewer. Allow overriding the selected bank for the game rendering.
Remove GetSpritePatternHack in ppu.rs.
Verify when the IRQ flag is supposed to be cleared. An update to the location of ClearIrq caused the apu_test jitter to have a different result.
       See newoutput: E24C  AND #$40                        A:10 X:00 Y:00 S:FD P:nv--dIzc V:242 H:117 Fr:4 Cycle:1

Wide pixels.
Move nestest over to new formatting system.
Disable OAMDATA writes (other than address increment) during rendering
Don't display bottom tiles of screen by default (see Aladdin junk tiles)
Proper encapsulation for PPU registers
Improve cycle accuracy of undocumented instructions
Open Bus for joysticks.
Other input devices.
Auto-mirror undersized CHR (for mapper 99 and maybe others).

FANCY NICE-TO-HAVES
APU frequency correction

UNTESTED
(Nothing known, but there is plenty)

BUGS
Holding down the arrow keys doesn't generate input quickly enough.
Gracefully handle bad CHR size? ((( Argus (J) [hM03][o2].nes ))) ((( Atlantis no Nazo (J) [hM03][b3].nes )))
Gracefully handle bad PRG size? ((( Boy and His Blob, A - Trouble on Blobolonia (U) [o5].nes )))
(Low priority) What should happen when BankIndex > bank_count when bank_count isn't a power of 2? Open bus?
Marble Madness: Bank-switching mid-scanline isn't working, text doesn't render.
Rollerblade Racer: Glitched status bar.
Wizards and Warriors 3: Bad scanlines at middle of screen. Sprite flickering.
Arkanoid: Extra sprite.
Tatakai no Banka: Flickering sprites.
Fire Emblem Gaiden: Blank screen.
Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2: PRG bank switching bug leads to JAM.
Mission Impossible 2: JAMs. Need to mirror CHR ROM due to it being too short?
mmc5test: black screen.
Dragon Ball Dai Maou Fukkatsu: infinite loop.

IMPROVEMENTS TO PRG/CHR LAYOUTS
Automatically add registers from every layout? Maybe not since certain layouts won't be used by certain boards.

FAILING TESTS

cpu_interrupts_v2: Are these failures caused by when process_end_of_cpu_cycle is called?

---------------------GAMES------------------------------------
MAPPER 0
Cheetah Men II [b1] (Doesn't work on nestopia either. Wrong tiles are rendered during some intro screens, probably due to the game relying on certain RAM values being present at startup)

MAPPER 1
A Ressha de Ikou (https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/MMC1#SZROM)

MAPPER 3
Athletic World (Freezes on nestopia too. Freezes at the beginning of the Hurdles event)

MAPPER 4
Crystalis - Junk on scanline above status bar.

MAPPER 5
Romance of The Three Kingdoms II - Sprite tiles are used instead of background tiles. Somehow MMC5 is supposed to be reading from the left pattern table even though PPUCTRL specifies the right table for background rendering.

MAPPER 7
Aladdin - Corrupted sprites, gets stuck in a loop writing to PPUDATA, JAMs.

MAPPER 16
Akuma-kun - Makai no Wana - Incorrect CHR ROM banks for bottom part of screen.

MAPPER 18
Magic John - Two flickering pixels on right hand side during the intro. (Possible IRQ off-by-one timing.)

MAPPER 21
Wai Wai World 2 - Severe flickering (sprites aren't drawn in time?)
Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2 - Partial bad pattern table on opening screen.

MAPPER 23
Tiny Toon Adventures - Status bar

MAPPER 66
Dragon Ball - Goku can't move to spots he should be able to.


MAPPER 71
Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy - Status bar jumps a scanline or two, some sprites flicker. Sprites over the character intros.
Fire Hawk: Can't move helicopter. Broken name table display. Need better DMC implementation.
Micro Machines: Junk scanlines through the middle. See wiki.

MAPPER 94
Senjou: Various including flickering.

MAPPER 152
Arkanoid 2: Top of opening screen zeroed out.
Ge ge ge no Kitarou 2: Game freezes.

MAPPER 180
Crazy Climber: Verify operation.

MAPPER 193
Fighting Hero: Background fails to render properly except for the demo.
	Proper name table is briefly populated on input, but then is blanked again.
Deep Dungeon 4: Accesses CHR RAM outside of the default provided 8KiB. Need mirroring?
