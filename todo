ROADMAP
1. Fully passing DMC tests.
2. Fully working MMC5.
3. Expansion Audio
4. Remaining test ROMs.
5. Joypad support
6. Proper sounding audio.

Investigate if lack of MMC5 Extended Ram CHR status register is causing bad renders.
Re-allow ReadWriteStatuses for MMC5 Extended RAM.
Add CHR bank viewer. Allow overriding the selected bank for the game rendering.
Remove GetSpritePatternHack in ppu.rs.
Wide pixels.
Move nestest over to new formatting system.
Disable OAMDATA writes (other than address increment) during rendering
Proper encapsulation for PPU registers
Improve cycle accuracy of undocumented instructions
Open Bus for joysticks.
Other input devices.
Auto-mirror undersized CHR (for mapper 99 and maybe others).
Mapper switch dialog for mislabelled ROMs.
Correct PPU address during sprite rendering
Unwrap review. Convert most to expect or Result.
Add {PRG,CHR} rom exact size as layout option?
Detangle Mapper::cpu_read
Fix Legend of Zelda pauses (joypad conflicting with DMC DMA samples?)
CPU mode debug screen, including DMAs

FANCY NICE-TO-HAVES
APU frequency correction
Allow banks to be configured to pass through PPU address bits, rather than custom logic being needed (see Sachen8259).

UNTESTED
(Nothing known, but there is plenty)

BUGS
Gracefully handle bad CHR size? ((( Argus (J) [hM03][o2].nes ))) ((( Atlantis no Nazo (J) [hM03][b3].nes )))
Gracefully handle bad PRG size? ((( Boy and His Blob, A - Trouble on Blobolonia (U) [o5].nes )))
(Low priority) What should happen when BankIndex > bank_count when bank_count isn't a power of 2? Open bus?
Marble Madness: Bank-switching mid-scanline isn't working, text doesn't render.
Rollerblade Racer: Glitched status bar.
Wizards and Warriors 3: Bad scanlines at middle of screen. Sprite flickering.
Arkanoid: Extra sprite.
Tatakai no Banka: Flickering sprites.
Fire Emblem Gaiden: Blank screen.
Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2: PRG bank switching bug leads to JAM.
Mission Impossible 2: JAMs. Need to mirror CHR ROM due to it being too short?
Dragon Ball Dai Maou Fukkatsu: infinite loop.

FLICKERING SCANLINE:

---------------------GAMES------------------------------------
MAPPER 0
Cheetah Men II [b1] (Doesn't work on nestopia either. Wrong tiles are rendered during some intro screens, probably due to the game relying on certain RAM values being present at startup)

MAPPER 3
Athletic World (Freezes on nestopia too. Freezes at the beginning of the Hurdles event)

MAPPER 4
Crystalis - Junk on scanline above status bar.

MAPPER 5
Romance of The Three Kingdoms II - Sprite tiles are used instead of background tiles. Somehow MMC5 is supposed to be reading from the left pattern table even though PPUCTRL specifies the right table for background rendering.

MAPPER 7
Aladdin - Corrupted sprites, gets stuck in a loop writing to PPUDATA, JAMs.

MAPPER 16
Akuma-kun - Makai no Wana - Incorrect CHR ROM banks for bottom part of screen.

MAPPER 21
Wai Wai World 2 - Severe flickering (sprites aren't drawn in time?)
Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2 - Partial bad pattern table on opening screen.

MAPPER 23
Tiny Toon Adventures - Status bar

MAPPER 48
Don Doko Don 2 (SMB 8) and others: Fix IRQ behavior to prevent flickering

MAPPER 66
Dragon Ball - Goku can't move to spots he should be able to.

MAPPER 71
Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy - Status bar jumps a scanline or two, some sprites flicker. Sprites over the character intros.
Fire Hawk: Can't move helicopter. Broken name table display. Need better DMC implementation.
Micro Machines: Junk scanlines through the middle. See wiki.

MAPPER 94
Senjou: Various including flickering.

MAPPER 118
Armadillo: Flickering scanline pixels

MAPPER 139
Final Combat: Junk tiles briefly flash during intro. Bad mirroring fold during gameplay.

MAPPER 141
Q Boy: Need to support CHR RAM (with no CHR shift)

MAPPER 180
Crazy Climber: Verify operation.

MAPPER 193
Fighting Hero: Background fails to render properly except for the demo.
	Proper name table is briefly populated on input, but then is blanked again.
Deep Dungeon 4: Accesses CHR RAM outside of the default provided 8KiB. Need mirroring?


Improvements over Mesen:
Magic John - Mesen has two flickering pixels on right hand side during the intro. REZNEZ used to have this, but no longer. IRQ or NMI off-by-two?
